# Updated Portfolio #2

This is my updated portfolio. It's updated to display a ballance of work & personal information about myself. 


### Used technologies

* Bulma - I've really growing to love this thing. It's pretty basic in functionality but helps me save time with padding & with a little custom code, it can go along way.

* HTML/CSS/ JS (not implemented yet, but is intended to trigger the naviagtion bar upon scroll using the Y cordinate distance from top.)


### What I could've done better?

* I could've honestly implemented a better modal, which I will do but I found myself too much time on the unneccary things so im just skipping for now to come back to it. I did the modal in accordance to the requirements of the instructions.
* Preferably, I'd have done a simple img with a hover effect that overlays the img with a color & shows text regarding the project, then I would've made the entire box clickable link to the live demo.
